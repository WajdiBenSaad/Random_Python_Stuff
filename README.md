Here is a collection of notebooks and datasets I used to test some concepts, or play around with data and libraries. 
It is a work in progress, and always updated with new stuff!   

[1- Using the Diabetes dataset and a couple of Models to see if we can optimize our predictions using various technics](/Optimized_Ensemble_Stack.ipynb)
 
[2- AutoML with TPOT Python Library](/Testing_TOPT.ipynb)
  
[3- OpenCV for computer vision and face detection](/OpenCV_for_computer_vision_and_face_detection_V02.ipynb)

[4- Generating Faces : work in progress](/)
 
[5- Scraping the internet : work in progress](/)

[6- Kaggle Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](/Jigsaw_Unintended_Bias_in_Toxicity_Classification_V01.ipynb)



Still More to come !
