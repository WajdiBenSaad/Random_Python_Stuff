# Random Python Stuff

Here is a collection of notebooks and datasets I used to test some concepts, or play around with data and libraries. 
It is a work in progress, and always updated with new stuff !

 [1- Using the Diabetes dataset and a couple of Models to see if we can optimize our predictions using various technics](/Optimized_Ensemble_Stack.ipynb)
 
 [2- AutoML with TPOT Python Library](/Testing_TOPT.ipynb)
 
Still More to come !
( any suggestions or remarks are welcome! )
